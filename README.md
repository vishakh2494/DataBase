# Blood Donation Management System

This project is aimed at creating database management system for blood donation center wherein there would be roles of blood donation center employees who dynamically interact with both donors and the recipients. The employees would have an information stored on their system comprising of the blood quantity and its composition that were received from the donors or the blood that were injected into the recipients thus keeping a track of all the necessary information for ease management.

This respective system would help the employees to keep track and maintain the blood testing equipment’s in the center and the blood bags in the preservative vault. This system enables the management to maintain the clean records of the donors, recipients, scanning equipment’s, employee’s info, blood bags and so on.
